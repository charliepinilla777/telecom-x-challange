Driving Retention: Professional Churn Analysis for Telecom X
Welcome to the customer churn analysis repository for Telecom X. This project, developed by Carlos Andrés Pinilla (Alura Latam student), aims to identify the key factors driving customer attrition and propose effective retention strategies using advanced data analysis tools in Python.

📊 Project Overview
Telecom X is facing a high customer cancellation rate. As a data analyst, your role is to collect, organize, and analyze relevant data to understand the underlying causes of churn. Through data cleaning, categorization, and exploratory analysis, this project seeks to extract actionable insights that will:

Profile customers with the highest risk of leaving.

Identify temporal and behavioral patterns associated with churn.

Provide a solid foundation for building predictive models and personalized retention strategies.

🛠️ Tools and Technologies
Python

Pandas for data cleaning, organization, and analysis

Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook for documentation and presenting results

🚀 Methodology
Data Collection and Organization:
Efficient downloading and structuring of data, ensuring proper categorization and column naming.

Data Cleaning:
Handling missing values, duplicates, formatting errors, and category inconsistencies using pandas.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
Detecting trends, correlations, and critical variables related to churn.

Insight Generation:
Extracting key conclusions to guide decision-making and predictive modeling.

🎯 Key Findings
Customers with monthly contracts, less stable payment methods, and lower total spending have a higher risk of churn.

The first months of the customer relationship are critical for retention.

Encouraging long-term contracts and improving payment experience can significantly reduce churn.

💡 Recommendations
Implement proactive onboarding and personalized follow-up programs for new customers.

Offer incentives to migrate customers to longer-term contracts.

Analyze and optimize payment methods, promoting more stable options.

Develop targeted retention campaigns for low-spending and non-senior customer segments.

Build predictive models incorporating the key variables identified.
